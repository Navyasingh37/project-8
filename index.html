<p>rose is a beautiful flower that comes in many colors like red, pink, yellow, and white. People love roses because they look pretty and smell very nice. Roses have soft, velvety petals that can be used to make perfume, which is a sweet-smelling liquid. Some people grow roses in their gardens, and others give them as gifts to show love or say “I’m sorry.” When you see roses, you might notice they have sharp thorns on their stems. The thorns help protect the rose from animals that might want to eat it. Roses are not just for looking at; they can also be used in foods. Some desserts have rose petals or rose water in them. There’s a special day called Valentine’s Day when lots of people buy roses for someone they care about. Did you know that the rose is the national flower of the United States? It’s true! Roses can also remind people of their feelings, like how red roses stand for love and yellow roses stand for friendship. When you take care of a rose, you need to water it and make sure it gets enough sunlight. Roses make the world a more beautiful place, and that’s why so many people enjoy them.</p>
